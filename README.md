# global-shark-attacks

## Introduction

Data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas of a messy dataset. In this case, the dataset was taken from kaggle.com and it contains global shark attacks registers.

In order to give some sense to my data cleaning, I searched on the internet some hypothesis and I did a fact check of it through global-shark-attacks.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, using the given dataset.

## Hypothesis: Is Reunion Island the most dangerous place in the world for shark attacks?

People call it the “Shark crisis” – since the beginning of 2011 the number of shark attacks tremendously increased on Reunion Island. It has become the most dangerous place in the world for shark attacks according to its coastline length. Indeed, 21 attacks were reported since 2011 – 9 of those were fatal. It reached the point of a “crisis” – an event that is going to lead to a condition of instability and danger affecting an individual, a group, a community, or in this case a whole island. It occurred abruptly and led to decisive changes in not only the security but also in the economic, political, social and environmental affairs of Reunion Island.

## Conclusion

Reunion has a mean of 1 attack each 65 coastline km per year for the last 5 years of the dataset (2011-2016). The next one on the ranking are the USA, with 1 attack each 331 coastline km per year. The hypothesis has been proved!!

You can find the output of my analysis in ./output/reunion_attacks.csv file.
